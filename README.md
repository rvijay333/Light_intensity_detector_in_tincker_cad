# Light_intensity_detector_in_tincker_cad
simulation in tincker cad using arduino uno  and a photo resistor , that detects the light intensity

my first basic project using arduino uno on tincker cad 
its a basic model that detects the light intensity on the photo diode (analog signal)
and depending on that value a certian amount of voltage is fed to the LED , that effects and appears as its brightness .
